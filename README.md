# HUFFMAN ENCODING

- The Huffman Algorithm efficiently compresses data by assigning concise codes to symbols, minimizing message size. This
encoding method facilitates rapid and accurate data transmission, necessitating receivers’ understanding of the symbol-to-code mapping for effective decoding.
